# Welcome to Tech Play

## Why am I doing this? ðŸ¤”

First off, the focus of this blog is not about being a tutorial blog or anything. I am not pretending to be an expert. I am using this space to write about and make videos about my experiences while doing works on things like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Linux, Clouds, things I use frequently, the plugin I use for my VS Code etc. So it's almost like a compilation of many information in one place. For example, I used to search the internet to find the best plugins for VS Code for Python usage. And many different users suggested different things. Maybe I setup my editor with XYZ plugin and maybe later I want to use another PC and editor there. And with the information I compiled here, I won't be needing to search Google meticulously. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
