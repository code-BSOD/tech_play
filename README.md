# Welcome to Tech Play

## Why am I doing this? 🤔

First off, the focus of this blog is not about being a tutorial blog or anything. I am not pretending to be an expert. I am using this space to write about and make videos about my experiences while doing works on things like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Linux, Clouds, things I use frequently, the plugin I use for my VS Code etc. So it's almost like a compilation of many information in one place. For example, I used to search the internet to find the best plugins for VS Code for Python usage. And many different users suggested different things. Maybe I setup my editor with XYZ plugin and maybe later I want to use another PC and editor there. And with the information I compiled here, I won't be needing to search Google meticulously. 😎😎

And I feel like one of the best way to remember about stuffs is to learn first, do it, practice it, teach others. And this blog style writing will help me solidify my knowledge as well. Best of all, I can just come back here if I needed any help with any problem I previously encountered.

I will also try to post links to the original articles/videos that I have used as references.

## Inspiration 💁 🙈

One of my main inspiration to start writing actually came from [Rachel Thomas](https://medium.com/@racheltho), co-founder of FastAI and a professor. You can read more about her article on why you should start writing or doing blog here: [_Why you \(yes, you\) should blog_ ](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)

## _Topics I will write about_

* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning \(Computer Vision, NLP\)
* OS \(Ubuntu, Mac mainly\)
* Cloud Computing
* Data Science
* SQL
* Reviews \(Editors, Products etc\)
* Tips & Trics
* And more if I fancy 😂
